NexusTerm is a modern, cross-platform serial and network debugging assistant built with Qt 6. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for hardware developers, embedded engineers, and network programmers, integrating Serial, TCP (Client/Server), and UDP communication into a single, intuitive graphical interface.

The application is particularly useful for debugging devices like FPGAs, microcontrollers, and IoT gadgets, with a special feature for automatically rendering received image and video streams.

### üêß Linux

#### Arch Linux
1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -Syu base-devel qt6-base qt6-serialport qt6-multimedia cmake git
    ```
2.  **Compile the project:**
    ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j$(nproc)
    ```

#### Ubuntu / Debian
1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install build-essential qt6-base-dev libqt6serialport6-dev libqt6multimedia6-dev cmake git
    ```
2.  **Compile the project:**
    ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j$(nproc)
    ```

---

### ü™ü Windows

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    - **Visual Studio 2019/2022**: Install with the "Desktop development with C++" workload. This provides the MSVC compiler, nmake, and the developer command prompt.
    - **Qt 6**: Use the official [Qt Online Installer](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer). During installation, select the Qt version that matches your compiler (e.g., `MSVC 2019 64-bit`) and ensure you check the `Serial Port` and `Multimedia` modules.
    - **Git** and **CMake**: Install from their official websites.

2.  **Compile the project:**
    - **Important**: Open a **Developer Command Prompt for VS**.
    - Navigate to the cloned repository directory.
    - Run the following commands:
      ```cmd
      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake ..
      cmake --build .
      ```

---

### üçé macOS

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    - **Xcode Command Line Tools**: Open a terminal and run `xcode-select --install`.
    - **Homebrew**: If you don't have it, install it from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh).
    - **Qt 6 and other tools**: Use Homebrew to install everything needed.
      ```bash
      brew install qt6 cmake git
      ```

2.  **Compile the project:**
    - We need to tell CMake where to find the Homebrew-installed Qt.
    ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -D CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(brew --prefix qt6) ..
    make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
    ```

## üèÉ Usage

After a successful build, the executable will be located in the `build` directory. You can run it directly from there.

- On **Linux** and **macOS**: `./FpgaAssist`
- On **Windows**: The executable will be in `build\Debug\FpgaAssist.exe` or a similar path.
